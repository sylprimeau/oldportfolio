						<h1>Superconvert</h1>
						<h2>Revolutionizing online unit conversions</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>Here's what you can do with Superconvert:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Perform your first conversion with 0 clicks. Just load the page and start typing in your number.</li>
							<li>Every subsequent conversion requires only 2 actions. Click once in the box and type your number.</li>
							<li>Assign any unit pair you want to each cell.</li>
							<li>Assign a different color for each cell.</li>
							<li>Hide cells to break up the layout.</li>
							<li>Save your custom layout (using a cookie) for the next time you visit.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If there's one thing I hate, it's clicking more than I need to. That's why I created Superconvert. I actually use it myself quite often.</p>
						<p>Every time I follow a recipe from a US-based website, I need to perform several conversions to metric. How many grams are in an ounce? How many milliliters are in a fluid ounce? How many liters in a quart? What the hell is 450&deg;F in Celcius??? </p>
						<p>Typical online unit converters require about 7 to 9 actions for EACH conversion you perform. Click category, click drop down, click source units, click drop down, click target units, click text box, enter number, click OK. If you need to do just 4 conversions, that's anywhere between 28 to 36 actions. There HAS to be a better way! LOL</p>
						<p>Superconvert attempts to make unit conversion as easy, fast and beautiful, especially multiple conversions.</p>
						<p>Superconvert simplifies this down to only one action for the first conversion and two actions for each additional conversion. This means you can perform the same four conversions in only 7 actions. Unless you're single, you really don't need all that extra action, do you?</p>

						<h2>You're not the only weird one in the world, you know.</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>Last year, I stumbled across a subreddit called "Does Anybody Else?", also known as "DAE". Simply put, it's a forum people share quirky things about themselves and see if anyone else shares the same quirks. It's a fun diversion and it's also comforting to know that you're not as weird as you may sometimes think.</p>
						<p>If you've ever been to www.reddit.com, you know that replies can be voted up or down. What I was interested in, however, was a quick way to see what percentage of responders also had (or didn't have) that quirk.</p>
						<p>So, knowing almost nothing about JavaScript, and literally nothing about PHP, I set out to make my own site just to see if I could do it.</p>
						<p>It took me about a month or so, but I did it! And man oh man, did I learn a ton along the way, (which was the real point of the exercise)!</p>
						<p>At the time, I was happy just to be able to do what I did. The site had several sort options, commenting, voting, etc., and I was quite proud of my accomplishment. Looking back now, however, I see that I could have done so much more with it, and I still may someday.</p>

						<h1>Online Photo Dictionary</h1>
						<h2>A fun way to learn new vocabulary and pronunciation.</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>I made this site about 4 years ago. I knew very little about HTML and practically nothing about CSS and JavaScript.</p>
						<p>But I had an idea and I wanted to create it so I got online and learned the basics. A bit of cut and paste here, a bit of cut and paste there, and voila. A working website that does what I want!</p>
						<p>I got the idea for this site when I was teaching English in Japan and wanted to create a better way for students to learn vocabulary than memorizing dry lists of translated words and then having to search for each word individually in traditional online dictionaries to hear its pronunciation. I also feel that, as much as possible, it's best to learn words without translating and in related groups.</p>
						<p>I eventually stopped making new content because the amount of work required to create each page was far beyond my time constraints. Depending on the complexity of the photo, it would take anywhere from 3 to 10 hours just to create the area map for one photo!</p>
						<p>Perhaps someday, if I get volunteers to help me with it, I may come back and continue where I left off and polish it up a bit.</p>

						<p>Who doesn't remember playing this classic when they were kids? Parents saw this as a great "educational" toy because it tested your memory. Kids just think it's fun to see lights and hear sounds.</p>
						<p>For this one, the JavaScript wasn't too difficult to figure out but in my quest to give it as realistic a look as possible, I learned a ton of CSS! I could have gone with a much simpler design and finished in half the time but I really wanted to take my time and learn as much as I could from it.</p>

						<p>Like my Simon Game project, this one took quite a bit of time to get just right. A lot of that time was spent on learning the CSS necessary to give it a pretty realistic look.</p>
						<p>The JavaScript logic was also quite tricky because there were many details that needed fixing as they were discovered. A lot of testing and attention to detail was required to end up with something I was happy with. Things like:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>does not accept two decimals</li>
							<li>user can change his/her mind about which operator to use mid-calculation (eg: enter "2 + x 3" and the answer is 6, not 5)</li>
							<li>works on touch devices</li>
							<li>operator precedence works as expected</li>

						<p> Looking at it now, I can't help but laugh at how bad it looks. I didn't know much about how to style things back then, nor did I realize how important styling is, but it worked.</p>
						<p>The additional languages were never really more than a programming exercise. I just wanted to teach myself how to add a menu.</p>

			<p>Hi. I'm Syl, I'm from Toronto, Canada and I've been teaching ESL in Japan for the last 20 years. I've been programming in my spare time since I was a teen and I've constantly used my coding skills to make games (for my classes), useful utilities (for myself), websites and web apps.</p>
			<p>After 35 years of creating software in my spare time for the sheer pleasure of it, I realized that I can't ignore my calling any longer and decided to pursue my true passion in life. I signed up for Free Code Camp, got my Front End Developer Certificate and now I'm looking for employment while I continue to work towards the Full Stack Certificate. I am currently available for full-time, contract and freelance work.</p>
			<p>I am fully able and willing to relocate anywhere in the world.</p>
			<p>As you can see from my photo, I love traveling and exploring new places and cultures. (That particular photo was taken in Batad, Philippines - home to some of the grandest and most beautiful rice terraces in the world.)</p>
			<p>I also have a YouTube channel called Slow Easy English that just surpassed 35,000 subscribers. Most of the videos are based around ESL lessons and practice but I also occasionally include talks on various other topics such as Japan, travel experiences, cooking, etc.</p>
